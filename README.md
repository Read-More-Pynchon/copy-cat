## About Copy Cat

This is a playground to explore and exhibit my skills in front end web development, consisting of:

- Producing accurate as possible copies of websites that I have seens and liked (tabs to the right)</li>
- Showcasing (below) some of the techniques applied (content below)
- Applying them to my own website as part of the design process</li>

All of this at present is work in progress but it will show something i guess.

Each website was completed by **visual reference only** - I looked and copied based on what I saw.

Included with each page is the published website for comparison.
